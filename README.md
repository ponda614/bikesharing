- The image "User Trips By Gender By Weekday" shows what type of customer uses the bike share program on any day of the week, subscribers and customer. Subscribers are returning users, and customers are categorized as single ride users. More users identifying as either males or females are subscribers, while most users under the customer categories are listed as gender unknown. Female bike subscribers are least popular on Wednesdays. Male bike subscribers are most popular on Thursdays, but most days have high usage for male subscribers in general. For customers the highest bike use time are on Saturdays and Sundays.

# Summary

- Since the trip duration for bike usage is under 20 minutes that is be safe to assume to place bike station about 20 minutes apart from each other. Another suggestion is to try to find an incentive to bring in more female bikers because the female biker usage is very low compared to males. Also it would be safe to look into saftey precaution for bikers in the city.

- For future suggestion two additional visualizations would be to include the age group and figure out which are the top bike stations in NYC.
